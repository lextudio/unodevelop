# T4 (Text Template Transformation Toolkit) — Port Status

Ported from MonoDevelop's T4 addin (`externals/monodevelop/main/src/addins/TextTemplating`), since
it's simpler and less AppDomain-dependent than SharpDevelop's own T4 addin
(`externals/SharpDevelop/src/AddIns/Misc/TextTemplating`, ~40 files, deeply AppDomain-based).
Even MonoDevelop's own host isn't fully AppDomain-free (see §1), but the actual UnoDevelop port
runs entirely in-process — no AppDomain isolation at all, which is the only thing that ever made
this genuinely hard, not anything Uno itself lacks.

## 1. Why the `#if !HAS_UNO` guards, and what they're *not* about

Two different reasons code got excluded here — worth keeping straight, since only one of them is
a real platform limitation:

- **Genuinely platform-incompatible** (needs a guard, no way around it): `AppDomain`-based
  isolation. Both SharpDevelop's and MonoDevelop's T4 hosts use a `TemplatingAppDomainRecycler`
  (recyclable AppDomain pool, so `<#@ assembly #>` references can be unloaded without restarting
  the IDE) — `AppDomain.CreateDomain`/cross-domain marshaling doesn't exist on .NET Core the way
  it did on .NET Framework. **The actual fix wasn't a guard — it was not needing the recycler at
  all**: `UnoTextTemplatingHost` (`src/Main/SharpDevelop/AddIns/TextTemplating/UnoTextTemplatingHost.cs`)
  already extended `Mono.TextTemplating.TemplateGenerator` directly and runs fully in-process.
  `Mono.TextTemplating` (already a `PackageReference` in this project) is the real, portable T4
  engine — the same one `dotnet-t4` and modern VS use. In-process execution accepts one
  trade-off both old hosts avoided: an assembly referenced by a `<#@ assembly #>` directive stays
  loaded for the process lifetime (no unload without restarting UnoDevelop). That's the standard
  modern-T4-host trade-off, not a regression specific to this port.
  Two small remaining call sites needed fixing, not guarding — `ProjectFileTemplatingHost` was
  never `IDisposable` (`TemplateGenerator` doesn't implement it; a stray `using var` in
  `TextTemplatingFilePreprocessor.cs` was just wrong) and `host.Session` needed to go through
  `Mono.TextTemplating.TemplateGenerator`'s explicit interface implementation
  (`((ITextTemplatingSessionHost)host).Session`), not a plain property access.
- **Not actually a Uno limitation — just an incomplete port** (fixed by adding the missing
  piece, not by guarding it out): `CustomTool.cs`'s `ExecuteCustomToolCommand` uses the WPF-only
  `FileNode` type, and `ProjectBrowserPad.RefreshViewAsync()` is a WPF pad — those needed real
  `#if !HAS_UNO` guards (rewritten separately for Uno, see §2). But
  `FileUtility.ObservedSave`/`FileSaved`/`FileErrorPolicy`, and the old static `ProjectService`/
  `FileService` facade calls, are **plain, portable C#** with no WPF dependency at all — they
  were just never included in the trimmed `FileUtility.Minimal.cs` that `ICSharpCode.Core.Uno.csproj`
  compiles instead of the full `FileUtility.cs` (which has its own overlapping-but-different
  member set vs. this codebase's `FileUtility.uno.cs`, so it can't just be swapped in wholesale —
  see the compile errors that approach produced). The actual fix: a new
  `FileUtility.ObservedSave.uno.cs` with just the missing slice (`ObservedSave` both overload
  families, `FileSaved`/`RaiseFileSaved`, `FileErrorPolicy`), and inlining the two one-line
  `ProjectService`/`FileService` static-facade calls in `CustomTool.cs` as their DI equivalents
  (`project.Items.Add(...)`, `IFileService.FireFileCreated(...)`) under `#if HAS_UNO`. So: not
  "Uno can't support this," but "this specific slice of `FileUtility` hadn't been ported yet" —
  now it has.

## 2. What's done

- **In-process T4 generation/preprocessing** — `TextTemplatingFileGenerator`/
  `TextTemplatingFilePreprocessor` (already existed), using `Mono.TextTemplating.TemplateGenerator`
  directly, no AppDomain.
- **Project-wide "Process T4 Templates..."** — `GenerateT4Command`, Tools menu.
- **Per-file "Run Custom Tool"** — new `RunT4CustomToolSolutionExplorerCommand`, Solution
  Explorer file-node context menu (shown for every file, no-ops for non-`.tt`/`.t4` files — no
  per-extension condition evaluator exists yet to gate menu visibility itself; a real limitation,
  not a T4-specific one).
- **"Add > New Item... > Text Template (.tt)"** — now available via the
  `Microsoft.TemplateEngine`-based template system (`docs/template-system.md`): UnoDevelop ships a
  bundled first-party item template package (`Templates/Bundled/TextTemplate`) and auto-installs
  it if missing, so clean environments can create `.tt` files without separately running
  `dotnet new install`.
- **Real `CustomToolsService`** (linked from `externals/SharpDevelop/src/Main/Base/Project/Src/Project/CustomTool.cs`,
  `BeforeBuildCustomToolRunner.cs`, `BeforeBuildCustomToolProjectItems.cs`,
  `BeforeBuildCustomToolFileNameFilter.cs`, `ProjectCustomToolOptions.cs`) — the actual upstream
  mechanism, not a hand-rolled substitute:
  - `FileProjectItem.CustomTool` (already existed, reads/writes the `Generator` MSBuild metadata)
    is the source of truth for which tool runs on a file.
  - **Auto-run-on-save**: `CustomToolsService.Initialize()` subscribes to `FileUtility.FileSaved`;
    saving a file with `CustomTool` set re-runs it automatically.
  - **Auto-run-before-build**: `BeforeBuildCustomToolRunner` subscribes to
    `SD.BuildService.BuildStarted`, gated per-project by `ProjectCustomToolOptions` (the existing
    "run custom tools on build" project setting, `customTool/runOnBuild` + `fileNames`
    preferences — no new UI needed, this reads properties the original SharpDevelop project
    options panel already wrote if a project had one, or can be set programmatically).
  - `TextTemplatingFileGeneratorCustomTool`/`TextTemplatingFilePreprocessorCustomTool` are the
    two `ICustomTool` implementations registered under `/SharpDevelop/CustomTools` in
    `UnoDevelop.TextTemplating.addin`, replacing the old ad-hoc "check `Generator` metadata by
    hand" dispatch in `T4TemplateRunner` — that now just calls
    `CustomToolsService.GetCustomTool`/`RunCustomTool`, the same path auto-run-on-save uses, so
    manual "Run Custom Tool" and automatic save-triggered runs are guaranteed to behave
    identically (same descriptor lookup, same `ICustomTool.GenerateCode`).
  - `ProjectBrowserPad.RefreshViewAsync()` (upstream's manual "refresh the tree after adding a
    generated file") isn't needed on Uno — `project.Items.Add(...)` already triggers
    `IProjectService.ProjectItemAdded`, which `MainPage.OnProjectItemAdded` already handles
    (in-place Solution Explorer node refresh, *and* the incremental Roslyn document-add from
    docs/language-services.md §4 slice 3 — a T4-generated `.cs` file gets picked up by the
    language service the same way a hand-created one would).
  - `SD.ParserService.ParseAsync(...)` (upstream's "tell the parser about the newly generated
    file immediately") is dropped — no `IParserService` is registered in this codebase
    (`language-services.md`'s `ILanguageService`/Roslyn replaced that whole system); the next
    access to the generated file's language service naturally re-reads current content, so this
    wasn't replacing lost functionality, just an eager-refresh optimization that doesn't apply
    to a different architecture.

## 3. What's still skipped, and why each one is a genuinely bigger lift (not just a guard)

Unlike §1's items, these need *new* infrastructure this codebase doesn't have yet — not just
adapting an upstream file:

- **`T4Parser` + `T4ParsedDocument`** (MonoDevelop:
  `MonoDevelop.TextTemplating/Parser/T4Parser.cs`, `T4ParsedDocument.cs`) — plugs T4 files into
  MonoDevelop's generic `TypeSystemParser`/`DefaultParsedDocument` abstraction (folding regions
  for `<# #>` blocks, error squiggles for directive syntax errors, an outline). UnoDevelop has no
  equivalent generic "parsed document" abstraction for non-C#/VB files — `ILanguageService`
  (`language-services.md`) is the closest thing, but it's shaped around Roslyn/LSP semantic
  analysis, not simple directive-block parsing. Two real options: (a) write a small standalone T4
  directive parser directly against UnoEdit's folding/highlighting hooks (bypassing
  `ILanguageService` entirely — T4 files don't need semantic analysis, just structural
  understanding of `<# #>`/`<#@ #>`/`<#= #>` blocks), or (b) add a minimal `ILanguageService`
  implementation for `.tt` that only implements `GetDocumentOutlineAsync`/diagnostics and stubs
  the rest. (a) is simpler and matches what T4 actually needs.
- **`T4EditorExtension`** (MonoDevelop: `MonoDevelop.TextTemplating/Gui/T4EditorExtension.cs`) —
  C# completion *inside* `<# #>` blocks (i.e., typing C# in a template gets real IntelliSense).
  Needs embedding a Roslyn completion session scoped to just the block contents, which is
  meaningfully different from `CSharpVBLanguageService`'s whole-file model — this is its own
  design problem, not a quick reuse of existing `ILanguageService` completion.

None of these block the core "write a `.tt` file, it generates code, saving/building re-runs it"
workflow from §2 — they're editor-experience and project-scaffolding polish on top of it.
